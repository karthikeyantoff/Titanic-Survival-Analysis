Project Name:Titanic Survival Analysis
Titanic Survival Prediction: Project Summary

Project Goal:To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

Dataset:Used a classic public dataset containing passenger information from the Titanic.

*Workflow:
    1.  Data Cleaning:Handled missing values using Pandas.
    2.  Feature Engineering:Created more powerful features to improve model accuracy.
    3.  Data Conversion:Converted all text-based features to numerical values.
    4.  Model Training:Trained a `RandomForestClassifier` model using Scikit-learn.
    5.  Evaluation:Achieved a specific accuracy score on the unseen test data.

*Libraries Used:Pandas,NumPy,Scikit-learn.
